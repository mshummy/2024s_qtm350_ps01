# A Perfect Wiki: A Utopia Data Science Project 
# Led By Max, Jonathan, Daniel

# Our project will be using webscraped data from Wikipedia. Wikipedia is a free-content online encyclopedia written and maintained by a community of volunteers. While it was originally only available in English, today it is provided in 326 different languages. Still, English articles are the majority, with western languages such as German or French following in number. Since Wikipedia is open for every individuals who have access to the internet, such disparity shows that the access to the internet is not equal for everyone. Therefore, by analyzing the number of contributions made in different languages, we can draw a outline of the different accessibilities in different countries. Furthermore, in some countries, wikipedia is censored, and this project can be a basis on analyzing how much censorship is happening in each country.
## Challenges
The greatest challenge for our process was controlling the versions between group members. It requires a good amount of communication between members so that progress is tracked and purposively worked upon. This was overcome by being attentive to any changes made by respective members as well as being intentional about the naming conventions of individual changes. 
## Contributions
Jonathan was tasked with both the description, objectives, and resources of the larger project. Max was given the responsibility of creating the title, detailing each group members' contributions as well as describing the challenges faced and how they were overcome.
