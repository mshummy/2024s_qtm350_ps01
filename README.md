# A Perfect Wiki: A Utopia Data Science Project 
# Led By Max, Jonathan, Daniel

## Description
Our project will be using webscraped data from Wikipedia. Wikipedia is a free-content online encyclopedia written and maintained by a community of volunteers. While it was originally only available in English, today it is provided in 326 different languages. Still, English articles are the majority, with western languages such as German or French following in number. Since Wikipedia is open for every individuals who have access to the internet, such disparity shows that the access to the internet is not equal for everyone. Therefore, by analyzing the number of contributions made in different languages, we can draw a outline of the different accessibilities in different countries. Furthermore, in some countries, wikipedia is censored, and this project can be a basis on analyzing how much censorship is happening in each country.
